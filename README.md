# Spring2025_Statistics_Lab

This repository contains several labs related to statistical analysis, data visualization, and hypothesis testing. The labs explore different aspects of statistics, including correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and data visualization using R.

## Contents

### 1. **Lab 1: Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations**
   - **Description**: This script explores the use of descriptive statistics and visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to understand the relationship between variables.
   - **Key topics**: Data visualization, correlation analysis, boxplots, histograms, linear regression.

### 2. **Lab 2: Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals**
   - **Description**: This script performs hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation, using methods such as the Wald and Wilson intervals, along with empirical coverage simulations.
   - **Key topics**: Binomial distribution, Wald and Wilson confidence intervals, simulations.

### 3. **Lab 3: Correlation Analysis with Permutation Tests**
   - **Description**: This script performs both Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis, visualizing the data and performing permutation tests to assess the significance of the correlations.
   - **Key topics**: Pearson and Spearman correlation, permutation testing, hypothesis testing.

## How to Run the Scripts

1. **Install R**: If you donâ€™t have R installed, download and install it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

2. **Required Packages**: The scripts use the following R packages. You can install them using the following commands in R:
